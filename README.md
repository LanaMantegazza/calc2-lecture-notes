## The Notes

Here is the PDF containing my version of the lecture notes for Calculus 2

## Content

This is a repository for my version of the Calculus 2 lecture notes, which I hope to be more useful than the ones we were provided for our module.

There's an outline of how I plan to structure the notes in [outline.md](outline.md), and the raw LaTeX is available in the [lecture-notes.tex](lecture-notes.tex) file.

## Link

The notes are available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LanaMantegazza/calc2-lecture-notes/main/build/lecture-notes.pdf). Please use this link when saving or sharing this document as it stays up to date with the latest version of the notes. The notes are still being written, but each commit provides a version that is complete up to a certain point and can be used as is.

## Feedback

Please provide as much feedback as you can, whether it's about the content, the structure, the formatting, or anything else. You can do this by opening an issue in this repository or by contacting me directly. It's my first time doing this so I want to make sure to learn as much as I can by having any fuckups pointed out.

If anything's unclear, weird, or wrong, please let me know and I'll fix it.

## Ongoing Support

Don't be surprised if this never gets updated again, could happen, we have no way of knowing.
